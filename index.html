                <li class="second-list"><strong>2001</strong> - Selected for the Youth National Team</li>

          <li>Apart from all of Saeid's achievements, he was mostly known for his amazing range of defensive & offensive skills. Alongside this, his deceptive jaw-dropping sets has had a huge impact in the way the Iranian team plays, thus entertaining and drawing in many viewers from all over the world. However, more than anything else, his gameplay ignited a greater passion for the younger generation and has contributed immensely to the ever growing popularity of volleyball in his home country, Iran.</li>
          <li>Without a doubt an honourable mention for Seyed Mousavi (the middle blocker for the Iranian National Team) is due. A close friend of Saeid's, a teammate whom he formed a unique and strong bond with as they shared many victories together and aided each other in both of their careers'.</li>

          <p>“I am trying to create a group that can play together in the same atmosphere and understand each other on the court. I let the players feel free as to how they want to play. If we continue doing this then the young players will be able to contribute their maximum and play without any pressure. We have to support them more and continue to show them the way Iran should play.”</p>
